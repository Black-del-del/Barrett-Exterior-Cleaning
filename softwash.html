<h2><center>Soft Washing</center></h2>
<h3><center>Smart, Safe, Effective</center></h3>
<p>Unlike conventional pressure cleaning which only uses water to blast the grime off your siding, Soft Washing utilizes specially formulated cleaning agents applied at low-pressure to clean your home.
​
You get a more thorough and long lasting cleaning too! The algae and mold inhibitors in our Soft Washing solution delay the reappearance of unsightly algae, mold, and mildew growth on your home’s exterior. This translates to cleaner looking siding for up to four times longer than you would find with traditional power washing!
​
Our revolutionary softwash method combines a high volume/low pressure water delivery system with biodegradable cleaning detergents.  It is gentle, safe, non-abrasive, and effective, and is manufacturers’ preferred method to clean any type of siding, roofs, decks and fences due to its ability to thoroughly clean delicate surfaces without damaging siding or removing paint from painted surfaces.
​
And of course, “low pressure” means no risk of damage. Too many homeowners have found out the hard way that high pressure power washing methods and delicate home siding do not mix! Our Soft Wash House Washing method is 100% safe for all types of siding and will not damage your home or landscaping.</p>
